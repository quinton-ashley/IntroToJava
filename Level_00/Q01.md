What is the difference between an if statement and a while loop?

What is a code block/scope?

What happens to variables created in a scope after the end of the scope is reached?

Each of the following code segments contain one or more errors. Explain the error(s), then fix the code.

```java
Scanner sc = System.in;
num = 8

while (num =< 7) {
  num = System.out.println("Enter a number greater than 7:")
}

System.out.println("Thank you!");
```

```java
while (guess.equals(myFavoriteFood))
  system.out.println("Guess my favorite food:");
  String guess = sc.nextLine();
}

String myFavoriteFood = "pizza";
system.out.println("You guessed it!");
```
