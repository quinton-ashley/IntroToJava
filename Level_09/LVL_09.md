## Nested for loops

A `for` loop inside a `for` loop? FORLOOPCEPTION! ðŸ˜®

```java
for (int row = 0; row < rows; row++) {
	for (int col = 0; col < columns; col++) {
		// nested for loop
	}
}
```

The first `for` loop goes row by row, then the `for` loop on the inside goes through all the columns in that row.

# Level 09 C

## Two Dimensional Arrays

A two dimensional array (aka 2D array) is an array of arrays.

```java
// red and black checkers on a checkerboard
char[][] board = new char[][] {
	new char[]{' ', ' ', ' ', 'r', ' ', 'B', ' ', ' '},
	new char[]{' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '},
	new char[]{' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'r'},
	new char[]{' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'r', ' ', ' ', ' '},
	new char[]{' ', 'B', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'b'},
	new char[]{' ', ' ', 'b', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'b', ' '},
	new char[]{' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '},
	new char[]{' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'b', ' ', 'b', ' '}
};
```

Two dimensional data, such as checker board piece positions, can be stored in two dimensional arrays. In the example `"r"` represents a single red piece, uppercase `"R"` represents a king (two stacked red pieces).

## 2D array access

How could we access the red piece on the top row?

```java
board[0][3]; // row is 0, column is 3
```

`board[0]` gets the first row in board array and the `[3]` after that gets us the piece at column 3 in that row array. How could we access the red piece in the middle of the board?

## Using nested for loops with 2D arrays

How could we use a nested for loop to clear the board of all the pieces by assigning a blank space " " to every element in the `board` array?

```java
for (int row = 0; row < rows; row++) {
	for (int col = 0; col < columns; col++) {
		board[row][col] = ' ';
	}
}
```
