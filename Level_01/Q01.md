# Quiz 01

The following code has a common error in the if statement. What is the error? How can it be fixed?

```java
if (num == 8 || 9) {
	System.out.println("The number is 8 or 9.");
}
```

Which boolean operator corresponds to the results in the following truth table?

Truth Table
x y
0 0 = 0
1 0 = 1
0 1 = 1
1 1 = 1

Rewrite the following code using the boolean operator &&

```java
// Without using boolean operator &&
if (a > 0) {
	if (b > 0) {
		System.out.println('All variables are positive!');
	}
}
```

```java
// answer here
```

Rewrite the following code using the boolean operator ||

```java
// Without using boolean operator ||
if (x == 0) {
	System.out.println('At least one variable is zero!');
} else if (y == 0) {
	System.out.println('At least one variable is zero!');
} else if (z == 0) {
	System.out.println('At least one variable is zero!');
}
```

```java
